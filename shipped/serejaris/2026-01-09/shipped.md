## The Ship

Launched vibecoding.phd — a resource for mastering the art of vibe-driven development with AI assistants.

## Why

Traditional coding tutorials don't cover the new workflow: prompting, iterating, and shipping fast with AI. This fills the gap.

## The Hard Part

Capturing the intuition. Vibecoding isn't about syntax — it's about knowing when to trust the vibe and when to verify. Hard to teach what feels like instinct.
