## The Ship

Launched shipped.md — the daily log that turns your work into a public track record. No pitch deck. Just shipped. Builders log what they ship daily, build streaks, and let the work speak for itself.

## Why

Tired of vague "progress updates" and engagement farming. Wanted a clean, quiet way to build in public — just facts about what you shipped and why. Your streak is your story.

## The Hard Part

Deciding what NOT to include. No accounts, no comments, no reactions — just Git + Markdown. Keeping it brutally simple when everything screams "add more features."
